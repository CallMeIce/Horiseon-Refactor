# Horiseon-Refactor

## Description

This project motivated me to do something more challenging and break out of my comfort zone. I built this specific project because the company wanted to see what I was capable to before they hired me. I was able to solve most if not all the bugs and was able to shorten the style.css to make it look a lot neater. I was able to learn how to switch divs out and input the actual html element while also learning how to shorten and tidy up a stylesheet.

## Installation

First, I had to pick a section to start with. I figured it would be easier to start on the index.html file. I ended up changing the title to the company's name so that the user can identify what page they're on. After that, I ended up changing all the <divs> into the correct HTML element. Once all of that was completed, I noticed that one of the links to the page wasn't working so I had to add an id to it and its approriate name to it. Took me a couple of tries but I got it to work in the end. I decided to look over the page to see if anything else was missing and noticed that the images were missing the <alt> attributes. Once completed and looked over, I went into CSS and started to see what was wrong with that. I noticed a lot of repititon on the page and decided to organize it and consolidated the page.
