# Horiseon-Refactor

## Description

This project motivated me to do something more challenging and break out of my comfort zone. I built this specific project because the company wanted to see what I was capable to before they hired me. I was able to solve most if not all the bugs and was able to shorten the style.css to make it look a lot neater. I was able to learn how to switch divs out and input the actual html element while also learning how to shorten and tidy up a stylesheet.

## Installation

First, I had to pick a section to start with. I figured it would be easier to start on the index.html file. I ended up changing the title to the company's name so that the user can identify what page they're on. After that, I ended up changing all the <divs> into the correct HTML element. Once all of that was completed, I noticed that one of the links to the page wasn't working so I had to add an id to it and its approriate name to it. Took me a couple of tries but I got it to work in the end. I decided to look over the page to see if anything else was missing and noticed that the images were missing the <alt> attributes. Once completed and looked over, I went into CSS and started to see what was wrong with that. I noticed a lot of repititon on the page and decided to organize it and consolidated the page.

## Usage

This is the Horiseon Website and it is a user friendly website. You just have to navigate on the top right where you see "Search Engine Optimization", "Online Reputation Management", and "Social Media Marketing". This are links that will send you to the designated spot on the page to get more information about that particular category.
